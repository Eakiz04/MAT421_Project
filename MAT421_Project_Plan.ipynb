        "Data collection of temperature often contains missing data due to various factors such as malfunctions with the measuring instrument, data transmission errors, data collection gaps, or simply human error. This missing data can significantly affect the accuracy of weather forecasting and climate models. To correct this missing data, **Lagrange Interpolation**, **Spline Interpolation**, and **Polynomial Regression** can be used to estimate the missing data to create a more accurate representation of the data. This project's goal is to use the interpolation methods and compare their results to the polynomial regression method to analyze and compare the accuracy of each technique."

        "Accurate estimation of missing temperature data is a common challenge many researchers attempt to understand better. One study by Afrifa-Yamoah, Mueller, Taylor, and Fisher (2020), examines the frequency of missing data in high-resolution environmental datasets and aims to resolve this issue through methods such as Kalman smoothing, ARIMA, and multiple linear regression. Their findings suggest that multiple linear regression model yielded the most accurate results. While their study focuses on different methods, their method of comparing various techniques aligns with this project's goal of assessing multiple approaches for handling missing temperature data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a second study by Rafał Jasiński (2016), the author explores the use of cubic spline interpolation and cubic polynomial interpolation to estimate missing data related to air temperature. The study concluded that cubic spline interpolation provides high accuracy, particularly for shorter time intervals. This aligns directly with this project's goal of evaluating the accuracy of spline interpolation for finding missing temperature data. This studies insights will prove useful as a guide for our expected spline interpolation results and provide a framework for analyzing the effectiveness of this method within this project.\n",

As these studies demonstrated, the type of method is essential for creating accurate estimations, and this project aims to build on their findings by comparing and analyzing the effectiveness of Lagrange Interpolation, Spline Interpolation, and Polynomial Regression in imputing missing temperature data"

Unlike Lagrange interpolation, which uses a single polynomial to fit all data points, spline interpolation fits polynomials to small sections of the data. Cubic splines are used where the points $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})$ are joined by cubic polynomial $S_i(x)=a_ix^3+b_ix^2+c_ix+d_i$ that is valid for $x_i \\leq x \\leq x_{i+1}$ for i = 1, ... , n-1.

Of the two interpolation methods, Spline Interpolation is likely to yield the most accurate results, especially for shorter intervals as described by Rafał Jasiński. On the other hand, Lagrange Interpolation may be less accurate due to its reliance on fitting a single polynomial expression to the entire dataset. However, more insights on the pros and cons of each method will be easier to establish after performing the experiment."
